# Interfacing Arduino with ST7789 TFT Display – Graphics Test Example

This Arduino tutorial shows how to interface the UNO board with ST7789 TFT display. 
The ST7789 TFT module contains a display controller with the same name: ST7789. 
It’s a color display that uses SPI interface protocol and requires 3, 4 or 5 control pins, it’s low cost and easy to use. 
This display is an IPS display, it comes in different sizes (1.3″, 1.54″ …) 
but all of them should have the same resolution of 240×240 pixel, this means it has 57600 pixels.
This module works with 3.3V only and it doesn’t support 5V
